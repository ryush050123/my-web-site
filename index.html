      <strong>Gates</strong> was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975,
      he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became
      the world's largest personal computer software company.Gates led
      the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO
      in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman
      of the board of directors and became chief software architect.
       During the late 1990s, he was criticized for
      his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive.
      This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.
       In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time
      role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda
      Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his
      then-wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000. He stepped
      down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and
      assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly
      appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board
      positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to
      focus on his philanthropic efforts including climate change,
      global health and development, and education.
